This utility is a compilation of Windows tasks I perform on each Windows system I use. It is meant to streamline *installs*, debloat with *tweaks*, troubleshoot with *config*, and fix Windows *updates*. I am extremely picky about any contributions to keep this project clean and efficient.

## Usage

Winutil must be run in Admin mode because it performs system-wide tweaks. To achieve this, open PowerShell or Windows Terminal as an administrator. Here are a few ways to do it:

1. **Right-Click Method:**
   - Right-click on the start menu.
   - Choose "Windows PowerShell (Admin)" (for Windows 10) or "Terminal (Admin)" (for Windows 11).

2. **Search and Launch Method:**
   - Press the Windows key.
   - Type "PowerShell" or "Terminal" (for Windows 11).
   - Press `Ctrl + Shift + Enter` to launch it with administrator privileges.
