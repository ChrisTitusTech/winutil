# Chris Titus Tech's Windows Utility

This Utility is a compilation of windows tasks I perform on each Windows system I use. It is meant to streamline *installs*, debloat with *tweaks*, troubleshoot with *config*, and fix Windows *updates*. I am extremely picky on any contributions to keep this project clean and efficient.
