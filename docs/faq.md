# FAQ's

## How do I uninstall WinUtil?
* You do not have to uninstall WinUtil. As it is a script you run from Powershell it only loads into your RAM. This means as soon as you close WinUtil it will be deleted off your system.

## I apply a tweak and now X doesn't work, what do I do?
* If you apply a tweak and it breaks something, you can always revert the tweak by select a tweak and clicking "Undo Selected Tweak".
