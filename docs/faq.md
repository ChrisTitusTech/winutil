# FAQ's

## How do I uninstall WinUtil?
* You do not have to uninstall WinUtil. As it is a script you run from Powershell it only loads into your RAM. This means as soon as you close WinUtil it will be deleted off your system.

## I applied a tweak and now something doesn't work, what do I do?
* If you applied a tweak and it breaks something, you can always revert the tweak by selecting the tweak and clicking "Undo Selected Tweaks".
