# Release 24.06.11

This release is an auto generated release. 

From now on any pull request on the main branch generates a release like this, which ensures you can rewind in time to ANY version of winutil. Also this makes it easy to launch winutil from github.com instead of using raw GitHub which is blocked in some countries. Big shoutout to KonTy for the auto release idea!
