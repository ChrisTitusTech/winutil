### Essential Tweaks
Essential Tweaks are modifications and optimizations that are generally safe for most users to implement. These tweaks are designed to enhance system performance, improve privacy, and reduce unnecessary system activities. They are considered low-risk and are recommended for users who want to ensure their system runs smoothly and efficiently without delving too deeply into complex configurations. The goal of Essential Tweaks is to provide noticeable improvements with minimal risk, making them suitable for a wide range of users, including those who may not have advanced technical knowledge.

### Advanced Tweaks - CAUTION
Advanced Tweaks are intended for experienced users who have a solid understanding of their system and the potential implications of making deep-level changes. These tweaks involve more significant alterations to the operating system and can provide substantial customization. However, they also carry a higher risk of causing system instability or unintended side effects if not implemented correctly. Users who choose to apply Advanced Tweaks should proceed with caution, ensuring they have adequate knowledge and backups in place to recover if something goes wrong. These tweaks are not recommended for novice users or those unfamiliar with the inner workings of their operating system.

## Updates
---

The utility provides three distinct settings for managing Windows updates: Default (Out of Box) Settings, Security (Recommended) Settings, and Disable ALL Updates (NOT RECOMMENDED!). Each setting offers a different approach to handling updates, catering to various user needs and preferences.

### Default (Out of Box) Settings
- **Description**: This setting retains the default configurations that come with Windows, ensuring no modifications are made.
- **Functionality**: It will remove any custom Windows update settings previously applied.
- **Note**: If update errors persist, reset all updates in the configuration tab to restore all Microsoft Update Services to their default settings, reinstalling them from their servers.

### Security (Recommended) Settings
- **Description**: This is the recommended setting for all computers.
- **Update Schedule**:
    - **Feature Updates**: Delays feature updates by 2 years to avoid potential bugs and instability.
    - **Security Updates**: Installs security updates 4 days after their release to ensure system protection against pressing security flaws.
- **Rationale**:
    - **Feature Updates**: Often introduce new features and bugs; delaying these updates minimizes the risk of system disruptions.
    - **Security Updates**: Essential for patching critical security vulnerabilities. Delaying them by a few days allows for verification of stability and compatibility without leaving the system exposed for extended periods.

### Disable ALL Updates (NOT RECOMMENDED!)
- **Description**: This setting completely disables all Windows updates.
- **Suitability**: May be appropriate for systems used for specific purposes that do not require active internet browsing.
- **Warning**: Disabling updates significantly increases the risk of the system being hacked or infected due to the lack of security patches.
- **Note**: It is strongly advised against using this setting due to the heightened security risks.

!!! bug

     The Updates tab is currently non-functional. We are actively working on a resolution to restore its functionality.

## MicroWin
---

* **MicroWin** lets you customize your Windows 10 and 11 installation images by debloating them however you want.

![Microwin](assets/Microwin-Dark.png#only-dark#gh-dark-mode-only)
![Microwin](assets/Microwin-Light.png#only-light#gh-light-mode-only)

#### Basic usage

1. Specify the source Windows ISO to customize.

    * If you don't have a Windows ISO file prepared, you can download it using the Media Creation Tool for the respective Windows version. [Here](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2156295) is the Windows 11 version, and [here](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=2265055) is the Windows 10 version

2. Configure the debloat process.
3. Specify the target location for the new ISO file.
4. Let the magic happen!

!!! warning "Heads-up"

     This feature is still in development, and you may encounter some issues with the generated images. If that happens, don't hesitate to report an issue!

#### Options

* **Download oscdimg.exe from the CTT GitHub repo** will grab an OSCDIMG executable from the GitHub repository instead of a Chocolatey package.

!!! info

     OSCDIMG is the tool that lets the program create ISO images. Typically, you would find this in the [Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/get-started/adk-install)

* Selecting a scratch directory will copy the contents of the ISO file to the directory you specify instead of an automatically generated folder in the `%TEMP%` directory.
* You can select an edition of Windows to debloat (**SKU**) using the convenient drop-down menu.

By default, MicroWin will debloat the Pro edition, but you can choose any edition you want.


##### Driver integration options

* **Inject drivers** will add the drivers in the folder that you specify to the target Windows image.
* **Import drivers from the current system** will add every third-party driver that is present in your active installation.

This makes the target image have the same hardware compatibility as the active installation. However, this means that you will only be able to install the target Windows image and take full advantage of it on computers with **the same hardware**. To avoid this, you'll need to customize the `install.wim` file of the target ISO in the 'sources` folder.

##### Custom user settings

With MicroWin, you can also configure your user before proceeding if you don't want to use the default `User` account. To do this, simply type the account name (20 characters maximum), and a password. Then, let MicroWin do the rest.

!!! info

     Please make sure that you remember your password. MicroWin will configure auto-login settings, so you won't have to enter your password. However, if you are required to enter your password, it's best that you don't forget it.


##### Ventoy options

* **Copy to Ventoy** will copy the target ISO file to any USB drive with [Ventoy](https://ventoy.net/en/index.html) installed
!!! info

     Ventoy is a solution that lets you boot to any ISO file stored on a drive. Think of it as having multiple bootable USBs in one. Do note, though, that your drive needs to have enough free space for the target ISO file.

## Automation

* Some features are available through automation. This allows you to save your config file, pass it to WinUtil, walk away and come back to a finished system. Here is how you can set it up currently with Winutil >24.01.15

* On the Install Tab, click "Get Installed", this will get all installed apps **supported by Winutil** on the system.
![GetInstalled](assets/Get-Installed-Dark.png#only-dark#gh-dark-mode-only)
![GetInstalled](assets/Get-Installed-Light.png#only-light#gh-light-mode-only)

* Click on the Settings cog in the upper right corner and choose Export. Choose file file and location; this will export the setting file.
![SettingsExport](assets/Settings-Export-Dark.png#only-dark#gh-dark-mode-only)
![SettingsExport](assets/Settings-Export-Light.png#only-light#gh-light-mode-only)

* Copy this file to a USB or somewhere you can use it after Windows installation.

!!! tip

     Use the Microwin tab to create a custom Windows image & install the Windows image.

* On any supported Windows machine, open PowerShell **as Admin** and run the following command to automatically apply tweaks and install apps from the config file.
    ```ps1
    iex "& { $(irm christitus.com/win) } -Config [path-to-your-config] -Run"
    ```
* Have a cup of coffee! Come back when it's done.
