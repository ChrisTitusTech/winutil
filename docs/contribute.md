* `./winutil.ps1`
* After seeing that your chnages work properly feel free to make a PR and follow the documentation below.

## Making a PR
* To make a PR on your repo under a new branch linking to the main branch a button will show and say Preview and Create pull request. Click that button and fill in all information that is provided on the template. Once all the information is filled in correctly check your PR to make sure there is not a WinUtil.ps1 file attached to the PR. Once everything is good make the PR and wait for Chris (The Maintainer) to accept or deny your PR. Once it is accepted in by Chris you will be able to see your changes in the /windev build.
* If you do not see your feature in the main /win build that is fine. As all new changes go into the /windev build to make sure everything is working ok before going fully public.
* Congrats you just submitted your first PR. Thank you so much for contributing to WinUtil.
