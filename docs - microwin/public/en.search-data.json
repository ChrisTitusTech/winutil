Run the latest pre-release irm https://christitus.com/windev | iex Warning\nThis is a pre-release and should be treated as such. It exists for developers to test the utility and report or fix bugs before they get added to the stable release. Don’t use it in production!\nIssues If you encounter any challenges or problems with the script, I kindly request that you submit them via the “Issues” tab on the GitHub repository. By filling out the provided template, you can provide specific details about the issue, allowing me (and others in the community) to promptly address any bugs or consider feature requests. Contribute Code Pull requests are now handled directly on the MAIN branch. This was done since we can now select specific releases to launch via releases in GitHub.\nIf you’re doing code changes, then you can submit a PR to main branch, but I am very selective about these.\nImportant\nDo not use a code formatter, make massive amounts of line changes, or make multiple feature changes. EACH FEATURE CHANGE SHOULD BE IT’S OWN PULL REQUEST!\nWhen creating pull requests, it is essential to thoroughly document all changes made. This includes, but is not limited to, documenting any additions made to the tweaks section and corresponding undo tweak, so users are able to remove the newly added tweaks if necessary, and comprehensive documentation is required for all code changes. Document your changes and briefly explain why you made your changes in your Pull Request Description. Failure to adhere to this format may result in the denial of the pull request. Additionally, any code lacking sufficient documentation may also be denied.\nBy following these guidelines, we can maintain a high standard of quality and ensure that the codebase remains organized and well-documented.\nNote\nWhen creating a function, please include “WPF” or “Winutil” in the file name so it can be loaded into the runspace.\nWalk through This is a guide for beginners. If you are still having issues, look at the following official GitHub documentation: Commit through WEB Commit through GitHub Desktop Create a Pull Request Overview %%{init: {\"flowchart\": {\"curve\": \"cardinal\"}} }%%\rgraph TD\rA[Fork Project] --\u003e B[Clone Repository];\rB --\u003e C[Create New Branch];\rC --\u003e D[Make Changes];\rD --\u003e G[Test Changes];\rG --\u003e H{Tests Passed?};\rH --\u003e|Yes| E[Commit Changes];\rH --\u003e|No| J[Fix Issues];\rJ --\u003e G;\rE --\u003e F[Push Branch];\rF --\u003e K[Create Pull Request];\rK --\u003e L[Fill out PR template];\rclassDef default stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px,font-size:12pt; Note\nThis is a diagram to guide you through the process. It may vary depending on the type of change you’re making.\nFork the Repo Fork the Winutil Repository here to create a copy that will be available in your repository list. Clone the Fork Tip\nWhile you can make your changes directly through the Web, we recommend cloning the repo to your device using the application GitHub Desktop (available in Winutil) to test your fork easily.\nInstall GitHub Desktop if it is not already installed.\nLog in using the same GitHub account you used to fork Winutil.\nChoose the fork under “Your Repositories” and press “clone {repo name}”\nCreate a new branch and name it something relatable to your changes.\nNow you can modify Winutil to your liking using your preferred text editor.\nTesting your changes To test to see if your changes work as intended run following commands in a powershell teminal as admin:\nChange the directory where you are running the commands to the forked project.\ncd {path to the folder with the compile.ps1}\nRun the following command to compile and run Winutil:\n.\\Compile.ps1 -run\nAfter seeing that your changes work properly, feel free to commit the changes to the repository and make a PR. For help on that, follow the documentation below. Committing the changes Before committing your changes, please discard changes made to the Winutil.ps1 file, like the following: Now, commit your changes once you are happy with the result. Push the changes to upload them to your fork on github.com. Making a PR To make a PR on your repo under a new branch linking to the main branch, a button will show and say Preview and Create pull request. Click that button and fill in all the information that is provided on the template. Once all the information is filled in correctly, check your PR to make sure there is not a Winutil.ps1 file attached to the PR. Once everything is good, make the PR and wait for Chris (the maintainer) to accept or deny your PR. Once it is accepted by Chris, you will be able to see your changes in the “/windev” build. If you do not see your feature in the main “/win” build, that is fine. All new changes go into the /windev build to make sure everything is working OK before going fully public. Congratulations! You just submitted your first PR. Thank you so much for contributing to Winutil.

You do not have to uninstall Winutil. As it is a script you run from PowerShell, it only loads into your RAM. This means as soon as you close Winutil, it will be cleared from your system. Winutil doesn’t install itself permanently on your computer.\nIs Winutil safe to use? Yes, Winutil is open source and the code is publicly available on GitHub. Thousands of users run it daily. However, like any system modification tool, you should:\nRun it as Administrator (required) Create a restore point before major changes Understand what tweaks you’re applying Download only from official sources Do I need to keep running Winutil? No. Once you’ve applied tweaks or installed applications, you can close Winutil. Changes persist after closing. You only need to run Winutil again when you want to make additional changes or undo tweaks.\nDoes Winutil require internet access? For downloading: Yes, installing applications requires internet For tweaks: No, most tweaks work offline Initial run: Yes, to download the latest script How often is Winutil updated? Winutil is actively maintained with frequent updates. New features, bug fixes, and application additions are released regularly. The script auto-downloads the latest version each time you run it.\nInstallation \u0026 Running How do I run Winutil? Open PowerShell as Administrator Run: irm \"https://christitus.com/win\" | iex Wait for the GUI to appear Why do I need Administrator rights? Winutil makes system-level changes (registry edits, service modifications, software installation) that require elevated permissions. Without admin rights, most features won’t work.\nThe script won’t download. What do I do? Try these solutions in order:\nUse the direct GitHub link:\nirm https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/Winutil/releases/latest/download/Winutil.ps1 | iex Force TLS 1.2 (for older Windows):\n[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12 irm \"https://christitus.com/win\" | iex Change DNS to Cloudflare (1.1.1.1) or Google (8.8.8.8)\nUse a VPN if GitHub is blocked in your region\nI get an “Execution Policy” error. How do I fix it? Run this command first to allow script execution:\nSet-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process -Force irm \"https://christitus.com/win\" | iex This only affects the current PowerShell session and is safe.\nTweaks \u0026 Modifications I applied a tweak and now something doesn’t work. What do I do? If you applied a tweak and it breaks something, you can revert it:\nOpen Winutil again Go to the Tweaks tab Select the same tweak you applied Click “Undo Selected Tweaks” The system will revert to the previous state Alternatively, use System Restore if you created a restore point.\nWhich tweaks are safe to apply? Safe for everyone (Essential Tweaks):\nDisable Telemetry Disable Activity History Disable Location Tracking Delete Temporary Files Run Disk Cleanup Create Restore Point Caution needed (Advanced Tweaks):\nRemove Microsoft Store Disable Windows Defender Remove all bloatware Disable system services Start with Essential Tweaks. Only use Advanced Tweaks if you understand the implications.\nWill tweaks survive Windows Updates? Most tweaks persist through updates, but some may be reset by major Windows updates (feature updates). You may need to reapply certain tweaks after major updates.\nCan I create my own tweak presets? Currently, Winutil uses predefined presets (Desktop, Laptop, Minimal, Standard). Custom presets aren’t directly supported in the GUI, but you can script your preferred configuration.\nWhat’s the difference between Essential and Advanced tweaks? Essential Tweaks: Safe for most users, improve performance/privacy with minimal risk Advanced Tweaks: More aggressive changes that may break functionality or compatibility. Use with caution. Application Installation How does Winutil install applications? Winutil uses Windows Package Manager (WinGet) and Chocolatey to automate installations. It downloads applications from official sources and installs them silently without bloatware.\nCan I install multiple applications at once? Yes! Check the boxes for all applications you want, then click “Install Selected”. They’ll install sequentially.\nWinGet isn’t working. How do I fix it? Go to the Config tab Find Fixes section Click “WinGet Reinstall” Wait for completion Try installing applications again Do installed applications have bloatware or bundled software? No. WinGet and Chocolatey install clean versions of applications without bundled offers, toolbars, or bloatware.\nCan I uninstall applications through Winutil? Winutil focuses on installation. To uninstall:\nUse Windows Settings \u003e Apps \u003e Installed Apps Or use the application’s built-in uninstaller Will installed apps auto-update? Applications with built-in update mechanisms will auto-update. You can also update them via WinGet/Chocolatey commands or through Winutil’s “Upgrade Selected” feature.\nMicroWin What is MicroWin? MicroWin is a feature that creates custom Windows installation ISOs with bloatware removed, optimizations applied, and unnecessary components stripped out before installation.\nIs MicroWin legal? Modifying Windows ISOs is a gray area legally. Use MicroWin for personal/educational purposes. You still need a valid Windows license to use the resulting installation.\nCan I install Windows updates on MicroWin? Yes, Windows Update works normally on MicroWin installations. Some removed components may be restored by updates.\nHow much smaller is a MicroWin ISO? Depends on what you remove. Typically:\nStandard Windows 11: ~5.5 GB ISO, ~20-25 GB installed MicroWin (aggressive): ~3.5 GB ISO, ~10-15 GB installed Will all software work on MicroWin? Most desktop applications work fine. Microsoft Store apps won’t work if you removed the Store. Some features may be missing if you removed their dependencies.\nUpdates \u0026 Maintenance Should I disable Windows Updates? Generally, no. Security updates are important. However, you might:\nUse “Security Updates Only” to avoid feature updates Pause updates temporarily for stability Disable only during critical work periods How do I re-enable updates after disabling them? Open Winutil Go to Updates tab Click “Enable Updates” Updates will resume normally What’s the difference between “Security Updates Only” and “Disable Updates”? Security Updates Only: Installs critical security patches, blocks feature updates (major versions) Disable Updates: Blocks ALL updates including security (not recommended) Troubleshooting Winutil won’t open after running the command Possible causes:\nAntivirus blocking: Add PowerShell exception Not run as Admin: Restart PowerShell as Administrator Corrupted download: Close PowerShell, reopen, try again Windows Defender: Allow the script My antivirus flags Winutil as malicious This is a false positive. Winutil makes system changes that antivirus programs may flag. The code is open source and audited. Add an exception if needed.\nAn application failed to install Troubleshooting steps:\nCheck your internet connection Try installing just that one application Review error messages in the output panel Check if antivirus is blocking Try the WinGet Reinstall fix Network tweaks broke my internet connection Open Winutil Go to Config \u003e Fixes Click “Reset Network” Restart your computer Connection should be restored I can’t access certain Windows features after applying tweaks Undo the tweaks that might have affected those features:\nReopen Winutil Select the tweaks you applied Click “Undo Selected Tweaks” If that doesn’t work, use System Restore to revert to a previous state.\nAdvanced Topics Can I run Winutil on Windows Server? Yes, Winutil works on Windows Server editions, though some features may not be applicable or may behave differently.\nDoes Winutil work with Windows LTSC? Yes, Winutil works with Windows 10/11 LTSC editions. Some applications may not be available depending on your configuration.\nCan I use Winutil in a corporate/enterprise environment? Yes, but check your organization’s policies first. Some tweaks may conflict with group policies or corporate requirements.\nHow do I automate Winutil for multiple PCs? See the Automation Guide for details on:\nConfiguration files PowerShell parameters Batch deployment Silent installation Can I contribute to Winutil? Yes! Contributions are welcome:\nReport bugs on GitHub Issues Submit pull requests for fixes/features Improve documentation Help others in Discord See the Contributing Guide for details.\nPrivacy \u0026 Security Does Winutil collect any data? No, Winutil itself doesn’t collect or transmit any user data. It’s a local PowerShell script.\nWhat telemetry does the Disable Telemetry tweak block? It disables:\nWindows diagnostic data collection Activity history tracking Feedback requests Usage statistics Error reporting (optional) Is it safe to disable Windows Defender? Generally not recommended. Only disable Defender if:\nYou have alternative antivirus installed You understand the security risks You’re in a controlled/isolated environment Will removing Microsoft Store affect security updates? No, Windows security updates are independent of the Microsoft Store.\nPerformance Will Winutil make my PC faster? Tweaks can improve performance by:\nReducing background processes Disabling unnecessary services Cleaning temporary files Optimizing startup programs Results vary based on your system and which tweaks you apply.\nWhat’s the best preset for gaming? Use the Desktop preset, then additionally apply:\nDisable GameDVR Ultimate Performance power plan Disable fullscreen optimizations (Advanced) Set display for performance (Advanced) How much RAM does Winutil use? Winutil itself uses ~50-100MB while running. Once closed, it’s removed from memory.\nError Messages “Access Denied” errors Ensure PowerShell is running as Administrator Check if antivirus is blocking changes Verify you have ownership of files/registry keys “File not found” errors during MicroWin Verify source ISO isn’t corrupted Ensure sufficient disk space (20GB+) Check ISO is an official Windows ISO WinGet configuration prompt won’t go away Type Y and press Enter in the PowerShell window. This only happens on first use and configures WinGet for your system.\nStill Need Help? Can’t find your answer?

Adjust power plan settings based on your preferences and usage patterns. Click on Additional power settings to access advanced power settings that may help. Identify Power-Hungry Apps:\nRight-click on the taskbar and select Task Manager. Navigate to the Processes tab to identify applications with high CPU or memory usage. Consider reconfiguring, closing, disabling, or uninstalling applications that use a lot of resources. Update Drivers:\nVisit your device manufacturer’s website or use Windows Update to check for driver updates. Ensure graphics, chipset, and other essential drivers are up to date. Check for Windows Updates:\nOpen the Settings app, and go to Update \u0026 Security \u003e Windows Update. Check for and install any available updates for your operating system. Reduce Screen Brightness:\nOpen the Settings app, and go to System \u003e Display. Adjust screen brightness based on your preferences and lighting conditions. Enable Battery Saver:\nOpen the Settings app, and go to System \u003e Battery. Turn on Battery saver to limit background activity and conserve power. Check Power Usage in Settings:\nOpen the Settings app, and go to System \u003e Battery \u003e Battery usage by app. Review the list of apps and their power usage. Disable or uninstall any you don’t need. Check Background Apps:\nOpen the Settings app, and go to Privacy \u003e Background apps. Disable or uninstall unnecessary apps running in the background. Use powercfg for Analysis:\nPress Windows Key+X and select PowerShell (Admin) in Windows 10, or Windows Terminal (Admin) in Windows 11. Run the following command to analyze energy usage and generate a report: powercfg /energy /output \"C:\\energy_report.html\" Open the generated HTML report to identify energy consumption patterns. Review Event Logs:\nOpen Event Viewer by searching for it in the Start menu. Navigate to Windows Logs \u003e System. Look for events with the source Power-Troubleshooter to identify power-related events. These may highlight battery, input power, and other issues. Check Wake-up Sources:\nPress Windows Key+X and select PowerShell (Admin) in Windows 10, or Windows Terminal (Admin) in Windows 11. Use the command powercfg /requests to identify processes preventing sleep. Use the command powercfg /waketimers to view active wake timers. Check Task Scheduler to see if any of the discovered processes are scheduled to start on boot or at regular intervals. Advanced Identification of Power-Hungry Apps:\nOpen Resource Monitor from the Start menu. Navigate to the CPU, Memory, Network, and other tabs to identify processes with high resource usage. Consider reconfiguring, closing, disabling, or uninstalling applications that use a lot of resources. Disable Activity History:\nOpen the Settings app, and go to Privacy \u003e Activity history. Turn off Let Windows collect my activities from this PC. Prevent Network Adapters From Waking PC:\nOpen Device Manager by searching for it in the Start menu. Locate your network adapter, right-click, and go to Properties. Under the Power Management tab, uncheck the option that allows the device to wake the computer. Review Installed Applications:\nManually review installed applications by searching for Add or remove programs in the Start menu. Check settings/preferences of individual applications for power-related options. Uninstall unnecessary or problematic software. These troubleshooting steps are generic, but should help in most situations. You should have these key takeaways:\nBattery health is the most significant limiter on your device’s runtime. A battery in poor health usually cannot be made to last like it used to, simply by closing some applications. Consider replacing your battery. Background applications that use CPU and memory, make lots of or large network requests, read/write to disk frequently, or that keep your PC awake when it could be conserving energy are the next major concern. Avoid installing programs you don’t need, only use programs you trust, and configure applications to use as little power and run as infrequently as possible. Windows performs a lot of tasks that may affect battery life by default. Changing settings, stopping scheduled tasks, and disabling features can help the system stay in lower power states to conserve battery. Bad chargers, inconsistent power input, and high temperatures will cause batteries to degrade and discharge faster. Use trusted high-quality chargers, ensure input power is steady, clean any fans or airflow ports, and keep the battery/PC cool.

With MicroWin, you can create images that have minimal bloat and no interruptions. This has an upside: you can get more done and use Windows the way you want.\nDue to MicroWin using standard Windows system administration tools, such as DISM (Deployment Image Servicing and Management), advanced Windows users (system administrators and tech enthusiasts) can continue making changes so that they can have their own set of customizations with their ISO files.\nIf you’re excited to try this out, let’s go through how to use it. You’ll be done in a short time!\nBasic usage To start with MicroWin, go to its tab. You will see the following:\nFrom this screen, you’ll have to do one of the following:\nSelect the ISO file: if you have already downloaded a Windows ISO file, select it and click OK Get an ISO file automatically: if you don’t have an ISO file ready, and don’t want to waste time going to the download page, you can grab the latest versions of Windows easily. Select your preferred version and the language of the ISO file, and its destination, and you will have an ISO file in no time. Note\nWhen downloading your ISO file, network conditions (such as speed and location) can affect the time you have to wait for the download to complete and the availability of such download.\nCompatibility You may be wondering if your Windows image is compatible with the MicroWin process. Because of this, we present to you a compatibility list:\nVersion Compatible? Windows 7 ❌ Not supported Windows 8 ❌ Not supported Windows 8.1 ❌ Not supported Windows 10 ❌ Not supported, But may work on the latest versions. Windows 11 👍 Supported (21H2-25H2) After getting information about your ISO file, you will see the following screen:\nRequirements To successfully use MicroWin with your Windows image, you need the following:\nThe latest versions of Windows 11 Enough space. We recommend having, at least, double the size of your ISO file. However, you may need more if you want to inject drivers Options Choosing your index By default, MicroWin will target the Pro edition of Windows. The Pro edition is a good baseline for IT administrators and end-users, due to the inclusion of Group Policy, the ability to join domains, and more things that you can’t find with the Home edition. For more information, check out this comparison chart.\nObviously, you should pick the edition of Windows for which you have a license. To change the edition to process, select the drop-down menu under “Choose Windows SKU” and select your edition.\nInjecting drivers If you want to use MicroWin on a real system, you may want to include the drivers for it, to avoid setting them up after OS installation. That’s where the options to inject drivers come in handy.\nInjecting drivers: if you want to install MicroWin on another system, simply check this option. Prepare a folder with the drivers of your system and specify it in the UI. To learn more about how to export the drivers, read the section “Exporting drivers” Importing drivers: if you want to install MicroWin on your system, you can apply the drivers of your system to the image by importing them. Combine that with the former option, and you can have your driver files stored permanently on your preferred location Injecting VirtIO drivers: if you plan on using the target Windows image with QEMU/Proxmox VE, or any UI that uses it (like virt-manager on Linux), you can automatically download the VirtIO driver ISO and put its contents into your ISO file Note\nInjecting VirtIO drivers is only supported on v25.01.11 and later\nOf course, you can continue without setting up drivers. Simply leave the options blank and continue with the process.\nHow do I export drivers? To export the drivers, you can do the following on many utilities:\nDISM To export the drivers using DISM (via the command-line), do the following:\nLaunch the command-line interpreter you want (cmd, PowerShell…) as an administrator Go to where you want to place the drivers with cd, and create a directory called “drivers” (md drivers) Run the following command: dism /online /export-driver /destination=\"\u003cpath-to-folder\u003e\" Wait for the drivers to be exported Driver Store Explorer (RAPR) To export the drivers using Driver Store Explorer (RAPR), do the following:\nGo to “File \u003e Export All Drivers” Choose the folder to export all the drivers to and click OK DISM++ To export the drivers using DISM++, do the following:\nSelect your active installation if you haven’t (it’s the first item) Go to “Drivers”, select “All” and select “Export” Choose the folder to export all the drivers to and click OK DISMTools To export the drivers using DISMTools, do the following:\nSelect “Manage online installation” in the home screen and accept the warning Go to “Commands \u003e Drivers \u003e Export driver packages…” Choose the path to export the drivers to (“Export target”) and click OK Other UIs To export the drivers using another UI, read its documentation.\nUsing VirtIO drivers After the drivers from the Ventoy ISO are copied, do the following if you can’t see any drives on your QEMU VM:\nIn the disk selection screen, select “Load driver” Click “Browse” and select D:\\VirtIO\\vioscsi\\w11\\amd64 (replace amd64 with ARM64 if you want to use Windows on ARM) Select all drivers in the list and click OK You should be able to see your disks now.\nCopying to Ventoy If you have a Ventoy drive, you can copy your ISO file to it quickly and easily. This is done after it has been created. To do this, simply check “Copy to Ventoy”.\nYou can learn more about Ventoy drives here.\nNote\nNewer versions of MicroWin images may have compatibility issues with ventoy.\nSetting up a custom user If you want to set up a custom user, effectively creating a completely unattended installation, you can set up a user name and password:\nNote\nTo set up a custom user, you need to specify its name, which cannot surpass 20 characters. Otherwise, a user named “User” will be created. However, you don’t need to set up a password. If you leave the password box blank, you can take advantage of auto-logons, but do what you think it’s best for your use case.\nAfter configuring all your desired settings, click “Start the process” and specify the location of your ISO file.\nNow, you have to wait for the magic to happen. This can take between 5-10 minutes, but it depends on the performance of your computer."},"title":"Microwin"}}
