## Known Issues and Fixes

### Launch Issues:

- Windows Security (formerly Defender) and other anti-virus software are known to block the script. The script gets flagged due to the fact that it requires administrator privileges & makes drastic system changes.
  - If possible: Allow script in Anti-Virus software settings.

- If you are having TLS 1.2 issues, or are having trouble resolving `christitus.com/win` then run with the following command:

```
[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol=[Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12;iex(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/winutil/releases/latest/download/winutil.ps1')
```

- If you are unable to resolve `christitus.com/win` and are getting  errors launching the tool, it might be due to India blocking GitHub's content domain and preventing downloads.

If you are still having issues try using a **VPN**, or changing your **DNS provider** to:

| `1.1.1.1` | `1.0.0.1` | or  | `8.8.8.8` | `8.8.4.4` |
