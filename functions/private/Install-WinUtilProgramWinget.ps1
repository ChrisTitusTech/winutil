Function Install-WinUtilProgramWinget {
    <#

    .SYNOPSIS
        Installs or uninstalls packages with WinGet and reports the outcome of each one

    .DESCRIPTION
        Emits one result object per package so the caller can tell what actually happened
        rather than assuming the run succeeded.

        Runs one winget command per package so a failure names the package that failed rather
        than the whole batch. Progress moves per package: winget hides its own progress bar once
        its output is redirected, so there is nothing to report from inside a single install.
