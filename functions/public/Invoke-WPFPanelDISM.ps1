    .SYNOPSIS
        Checks for system corruption using Chkdsk, SFC, and DISM

    .DESCRIPTION
        1. Chkdsk    - Fixes disk and filesystem corruption
        2. SFC Run 1 - Fixes system file corruption, and fixes DISM if it was corrupted
        3. DISM      - Fixes system image corruption, and fixes SFC's system image if it was corrupted
        4. SFC Run 2 - Fixes system file corruption, this time with an almost guaranteed uncorrupted system image
